## 💡 The Story Behind College Connect

During our college and hackathon journeys, every techie faced this struggle:  
> “Where can I find the right teammates, mentors, and opportunities — all in one place?”

We turned that frustration into a fully functional platform.

**College Connect empowers students to:**
- 🤝 Find hackathon teammates based on skills and interests  
- 🗓️ Discover and register for tech events effortlessly  
- 🎓 Connect with alumni for mentorship and job referrals  
- 📚 Share and access curated learning resources  
- 🌐 Build genuine collaboration across college communities  

Our goal is simple — **make innovation and collaboration accessible for every student**, not just a few.
